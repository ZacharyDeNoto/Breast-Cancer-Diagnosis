# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis

**Intro** - Millions of individuals are diagnosed and killed by breast cancer each year. Knowing family and friends who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, I wanted to do a research project on a topic very near important to me. With this report, my goal was to see if it was possible to predict the diagnosis benign or malignant cells based on the factors of the breast cancer cell neuclei. Also it was to see what factors most impact the diagnosis and if it was possible to predict the other factors such as texture, area, and perimeter.

**Tools** - Python, R, Pandas, Keras

**Data** - Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

**Methods/Evaluation/Techniques** - Distributions, Machine learning, Model fitting

**Conclusion** - It appears that based on the factors of the dataset, you can accurately predict if a cell is benign or malignant with high accuracies in the 90% to 98% accuracy range. Also the top factors to attribute to the diagnosis are concave points and perimeter. Some facors from the dataset were able to be predicted with high accuracies such as radius and texture, while other factors like perimeter and area were much harder to predict with low accuracies achieved testing out several models.
